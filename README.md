# Attention Sampling - Pytorch
This is a PyTorch implementation of the the paper: ["Processing Megapixel Images with Deep Attention-Sampling Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03711). This repository is based on the [original repository](https://github.com/idiap/attention-sampling) belonging to this paper which is written in TensorFlow.

## Porting to PyTorch
The code from the original repository has been rewritten to to a PyTorch 1.4.0 implementation. The most difficult part was rewriting the functions that extract the patches from the high resolution image. The original version uses special C/C++ files for this, I have done this in native Python. This is probably more inefficient and slower because it requires a nested for-loop. I tested with performing the patch extraction in parallel but this adds so much overhead that it is actually slower. 

Furthermore, I hope I implemented the part where the expectation is calculated correctly. This uses a custom `backward()` function and I hope there are no bugs in it. 

##  Performance
This code repository has been tested on two of the tasks mentioned in the original paper: the Mega-MNIST and the traffic sign detection task. This code base yields comparable results on both tasks. However, the traffic sign detection task requires approximately twice as many epochs to achieve similar results. These experiments can be run by running `mega_mnist.py` and `speed_limits.py`.

## Installation
Dependencies can be found inside the `requirements.txt` file. To install, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. This code repository defaults to running on a GPU if it is available. It has been tested on both CPU and GPU.
